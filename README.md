<p align="center"> A definitive list of the best of everything open source</p>

<p align="center"><code>Status: Active</code> - <code>License: MIT</code></p>

> [!NOTE]  
> The list is currently edited directly from the readme, however my goal for the 1.0 release is for all open-source projects to be under a ```list.json``` file with scripts that automatically generate the readme. This would automate organization and make re-ordering far easier whilst enabling API retrieval of repository stats for always up to date star counts and descriptions. Consult the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for further information regarding development.

> [!TIP]  
> Submit or make changes by forking this repo, editing, commiting, and opening a pull-request. For more information on [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) for open-source software submissions, consult their respective pages. 

> [!CAUTION]  
> Starcounts are hard-coded and may not reflect latest values. API retrieval system of stars planned for 1.0 release.

## Why another list?
There's plenty of awesome lists on GitHub, many focusing on open source specifically. However I've found them including many long-deprecated apps, cluttered with smaller projects on the verge of extinction, or missing a lot of modern open source projects. 

This list aims to be comprehensive and highly curated, consolidating only the best open source projects. Mostly apps with a solid user base, solid set of contributors, and visible long term growth are included. These criteria are nothing more than suggestions, however, and projects with potential or ones that set out on a unique path can bypass the above criteria.
